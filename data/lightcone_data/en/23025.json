The ocean of memoria roars with mountainous waves and she, like a singular tiny spark, may be doused at any moment in the storm.<br />\"For one who cannot dream to enter the Synesthesia Dreamscape, they would have to pay a price comparable to death.\"<br />She can still hear her companions' concerned voices next to her ears. She takes a deep breath and dives into the Memory Zone.<br />As the vessel silently sinks into the depth of the Memory Zone, small pinpricks of firefly lights dissipate from the cracks and are then immediately swallowed up by the endless darkness.<br /><br />\"Wherefore do you hurtle unto death?\"<br />In the ocean of memoria that grows deeper and deeper, the weak light emitted by the Memory Zone creatures are like faraway eyes that nonchalantly glance at her.<br /><br />Dreams remained too distant for her. She gazes emptily out at the boundless darkness, her body and soul having reached the breakdown threshold long ago under the heavy pressure of memoria. Though she realizes her consciousness is gradually fading, only those remaining memories are playing over and over in her brain —<br />The Swarm that covered the sky tore through the frontline defenses as she flew towards the Swarm while enveloped in fire. The charred ash of the Swarm faded like snow, under which lies the pitch-black carcasses of the knights.<br />She didn't even have the time to take a bouquet and offer her final acknowledgement to knights, who were dying one after another. Their lives bloomed in the blink of an eye and went out equally fleetingly. Like a string of genetic code, they never possessed names and only had numbers allotted instead.<br /><br />\"Wherefore do you live?\"<br />In the deathly silence, like flames dissolving in the sea, she is reduced to a singular spot of fire and unendingly progresses towards the light...<br />She opens her eyes after what seems to be forever. She sees the \"future\" looking like a pearl, radiating with a soft and vague light. Tears stream down her face —<br />\"I do it to find... my own 'dream'...\"",
