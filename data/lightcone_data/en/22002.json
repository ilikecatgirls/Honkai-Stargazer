I must meticulously map it out!<br />The girl, packing away her surveying tools, gazes at the new world within reach, filled with anticipation.<br />\"That place is a mess. Don't you run off once we get there. I won't have you two getting kidnapped again...\"<br />The man in cowboy attire grumbles as he cleans his weapon, then walks over to the sofa with a drink, shaking his head in resignation.<br />\"The Land of the Dreams promises infinite possibilities. We'll surely make our mark... Hey, conductor, if we fall in love with that place and never return, would you miss us?\"<br />The Nameless dressed like a gentleman winks at Pom-Pom, smiling.<br />\"'You can't joke at the conductor's expense like this!' Is that what you want to say, conductor?\" The girl's mischievous grin spreads across her face.<br />\"You guys are! So! Mean!\"<br />Bubbles drift up and down in the glass as the Express fills up with joyful laughter.<br />...<br />The youthful silhouettes of these Nameless get gradually swallowed by memoria.<br />\"Have a... safe... trip...please...\"<br />When the conductor turns their head, the Express is already empty.<br />The conductor stand frozen, this scene hauntingly familiar, as if lived through countless times before.",
